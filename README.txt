Arrow Armageddon

Description:

	Arrow Armageddon is high-difficulty 2D scrolling platformer aimed at fooling the player with various traps.
	Due to the instant death mechanic, you will need to be very careful and gradually learn how to deal with
	each trap successively. There are 3 levels in total, the last of which is a boss stage.

==Controls==

Movement:
WASD / Arrows / Joystick

Jump:
Space bar / Joystick Button

Shoot:
Left-click / Left-Shift

==Hints==
 - Level 1: For the final arrow, jump just far enough to trigger it and land back on the same platform. It'll be safe to land then.
 
 - Level 2: To avoid the rain of arrows, stop at the top of the hill and jump right as you pass the tree, 
			making sure your arrow goes off right before you land below. This isn't necessary, but it makes it much easier to time.
			
			To survive the stampede, jump just as you hear the arrows go off and continue jumping until the end. There's a pattern to it.
			
 - Level 3: You can jump above the arrows with precise timing. Make sure you're close to him for the phase change.
 
 ** Since you'll probably need to see the whole game to properly grade it, there's a built-in God Mode option. 
	Simply press 'G', or turn it off with 'H'. I would recommend against it though since it kind of defeats the purpose of the game 
	and allows you to do things you shouldn't be able to.
 
There's also a very quick playthrough uploaded here: http://youtu.be/5z1B7mNq0Dw 
	*This makes the game look deceptively short since I know all the tricks, it should take much longer to complete the first time around. 
	 I'd rather you didn't watch it until you've either beaten the game, given up, or need to see how a certain mechanic is dealt with.
